pbh_simulations

1. RFsim3d_v1.ipynb is the notebook for running simulations on the cluster
2. Statistic_info returns all the statistical information of the exponential distribution.
3. The Gaussian field simulation must run with double precision. The upload figures (png) demonstrate the loss of information for single precision during the fast-fourier transform.
